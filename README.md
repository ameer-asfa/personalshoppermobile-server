# Personal Shopper Mobile Application - Final Year Project

This project was created as my final year project for my bachelor's degree. It is an E-Commerce mobile application made with Flutter version 2.8, Dart and NodeJS connected with MySQL. Currently, it can only run Android phones. The project has two main users, Personal Shopper and Customers. Personal shoppers are essential people who do paid services to purchace items that are usually not available online, or offer a cheaper price than retailers. This system aims to help create a standardized platform that personal shopper does not have.
